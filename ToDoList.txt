* Finish off SQL and move across to using this entirely - remove devices.txt and usernames.txt and status.xml
* Move personal stuff out of source code (eg weather and place) and into a "config.txt" file

Bugs
* Occasionally stalls!  But then recovers as if nothing had happened.
* PySerial still in a mess.  Seems to stall when writing serial, and then never writes anything further
* Cannot edit usernames when adding (auto-refresh loses edits!).  Can edit in devices page
