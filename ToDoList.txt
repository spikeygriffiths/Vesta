***** Features: *****
* Group devices, eg StairsLamp & landingLamp as "StairLamps".  Use Groups table in database to have a userName and list of devIdxs - on web page as drop-down list?
* Daily synopsis to use HTML email to show UpTime & snapshot of devices page, plus last day's activity log.  Customise and improve synopsis, so that we can have different synopses daily, weekly or monthly...
* New command to report channel, PAN id, Ext PAN id for ShowOneDevice page to use when displaying hub info
* Auto-start network ("AT+EN") if ATN shows none available at start up
* Colour lamp control
* Multiple device ZigBee endpoints?

Bugs
* Occasionally stalls!  But then recovers as if nothing had happened.  Suspect stalled messages for other devices
* Still get stupid serial errors!!!  But only when headless...
