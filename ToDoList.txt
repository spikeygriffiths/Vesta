***** Features: *****
* Group devices, eg StairsLamp & landingLamp as "StairLamps".  Use Groups table in database to have a grpIdx with userName and list of devIdxs - on web page as drop-down list?
* Consider one message in flight per device. rather than per hub, to avoid ERROR 66
* Daily synopsis to use HTML email to show UpTime (from status.xml) & snapshot of devices page, plus last day's activity log.  Customise and improve synopsis, so that we can have different synopses daily, weekly or monthly...
* Rules to include day of week, day of month and month for proper schedules
* Auto-start network ("AT+EN") if ATN shows none available at start up
* Colour lamp control
* Multiple device ZigBee endpoints?
